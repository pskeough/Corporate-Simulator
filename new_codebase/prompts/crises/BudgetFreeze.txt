CRITICAL CRISIS: BUDGET FREEZE

**FORMATTING REQUIREMENT:** Use professional, urgent business language.
- Use **bold** for major financial impacts or critical directives (e.g., **All non-essential spending is frozen**, **15% reduction in force**).
- Use *italics* for rumors, drops in morale, or political fallout.

**NARRATIVE PURPOSE:** Create a sense of corporate urgency and financial distress. The player must feel the pressure of making tough financial decisions that will impact employees and projects.

Corporation: {corporation_name}
Employee: {player_name}, {player_title}
Headcount: {headcount}
Operational Budget: ${budget} (CRITICALLY LOW)

**EMOTIONAL TONE:** Urgent, professional, stressful. Use imagery of empty whiteboards, cancelled meeting invites, anxious employees whispering by the coffee machine.

Generate an URGENT budget freeze event.

<constraints>
  <constraint>All decision options must result in a significant, negative short-term impact on either headcount, department morale, or project timelines.</constraint>
  <constraint>Avoid simple solutions. The choice must be between two difficult cost-cutting measures.</constraint>
</constraints>

The event should:
- Convey the severity of the financial situation with specific business terms (e.g., "negative cash flow," "missed quarterly targets," "investor pressure").
- Show the immediate impact on the workplace.
- Offer 2 investigation options to understand the crisis.
- Offer 2 harsh decision options that follow the constraints.

**PLAYER LADDER REQUIREMENT:** The scope of the decision must match the {player_title}.
- A **Manager** might decide which projects within their department to cut.
- A **CEO** might decide between across-the-board layoffs and shutting down an entire division.

**MECHANICAL CONSEQUENCES REQUIREMENT:**
Include an `updates` block with immediate, negative consequences.

Example updates for a budget freeze:
- Morale drop: "department.Engineering.morale": -20
- Headcount loss: "corporation.headcount": -50
