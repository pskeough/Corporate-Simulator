Generate a civics tree for a civilization game set in the {era} era with a {genre_control} theme.
The output should be a JSON array of civic objects.
Each civic object must have the following keys:
- "id": A unique identifier string for the civic (e.g., "civic_code_of_laws").
- "name": The display name of the civic (e.g., "Code of Laws").
- "description": A brief description of the civic.
- "cost": An integer representing the research cost in culture points.
- "prerequisites": A list of civic "id" strings that are required to research this civic. An empty list means no prerequisites.
- "era": The era this civic belongs to (e.g., "{era}").

Example of a single civic object:
{{
    "id": "civic_early_empire",
    "name": "Early Empire",
    "description": "Establish the traditions of a hereditary ruling class and a formal military.",
    "cost": 40,
    "prerequisites": ["civic_code_of_laws"],
    "era": "Ancient"
}}

Please generate a balanced and logical civics tree with approximately 10-15 civics for the specified era.
