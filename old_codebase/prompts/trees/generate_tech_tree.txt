- "name": The display name of the technology (e.g., "Archery").
- "description": A brief description of the technology.
- "cost": An integer representing the research cost in science points.
- "prerequisites": A list of technology "id" strings that are required to research this technology. An empty list means no prerequisites.
- "era": The era this technology belongs to (e.g., "{era}").

Example of a single technology object:
{{
    "id": "tech_pottery",
    "name": "Pottery",
    "description": "The art of creating vessels from clay, allowing for better storage of food and water.",
    "cost": 25,
    "prerequisites": [],
    "era": "Ancient"
}}

Please generate a balanced and logical technology tree with approximately 10-15 technologies for the specified era.
