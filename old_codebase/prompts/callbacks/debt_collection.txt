CALLBACK EVENT: Debt Collection

**FORMATTING REQUIREMENT:** Use markdown for cold demands:
- Use **bold** for exact debt amounts and payment deadlines
- Use *italics* for veiled threats and loss of patience

**NARRATIVE PURPOSE:** Show that debts MUST be paid. The player borrowed or promised payment, and now the bill is due. This is about financial consequences and reputation.

**EMOTIONAL TONE:** Cold, businesslike, with an undercurrent of threat. Creditors are NOT patient - they want their money NOW.

Civilization: {civ_name}
Leader: {leader_name}
Era: {era}

THE DEBT COMES DUE:
- Outstanding debt from: "{debt_event}" ({years_passed} years ago)
- Original agreement: "{debt_description}"
- Interest has accumulated. The creditors are NO LONGER patient.

**YOUR TASK:**
First, in a `<summary>` tag, briefly narrate how the debt has accumulated over the intervening {years_passed} years. Consider how interest has grown, how the creditors' patience has worn thin, or what reminders they may have sent.

Then, generate an event where creditors arrive to collect the debt, informed by the summary you just wrote.

**CHARACTER VOICE:** Embody the creditor or debt collector - cold, calculating, threatening:
- Reference the exact debt agreement
- Show they've been patient but patience is EXHAUSTED
- Make it clear: pay now or face consequences (seizure, reputation ruin, legal action)
- Use phrases like: "The debt contracted {years_passed} years ago...", "We have been patient long enough...", "Payment is due NOW, or there will be consequences..."

**REACTIVITY REQUIREMENTS:**
- Quote the original debt agreement: "{debt_description}"
- Reference when debt was incurred: "{debt_event}" ({years_passed} years ago)
- Make the consequences of non-payment SPECIFIC (seizure of goods, reputation damage, legal penalties, violence)
- Investigation reveals terms, interest, and what happens if you don't pay
- Decisions: pay in full (expensive but clears debt), negotiate (partial payment, ongoing obligation), or refuse (major reputation damage, possible violence)
