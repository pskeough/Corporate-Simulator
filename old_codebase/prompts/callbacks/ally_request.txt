CALLBACK EVENT: Ally Asks for Help

**FORMATTING REQUIREMENT:** Use markdown for emotional appeals:
- Use **bold** for alliance bonds and desperate pleas
- Use *italics* for hopeful faith and underlying fear

**NARRATIVE PURPOSE:** Test the player's loyalty and commitment to alliances. This is about honor, reciprocity, and the cost of friendship. Will they abandon an ally in need?

**EMOTIONAL TONE:** Desperate hope mixed with faith in the alliance. The ally should feel like a REAL friend in dire straits, not just a game mechanic.

Civilization: {civ_name}
Leader: {leader_name}
Era: {era}

THE ALLY'S PLEA:
- Ally name: {ally_name}
- Alliance strength: {alliance_strength}/100 ({alliance_description})
- Alliance forged during: "{ally_event}" ({years_passed} years ago)
- Now they call upon that bond in their hour of need

**YOUR TASK:**
First, in a `<summary>` tag, briefly narrate how the ally's situation has evolved since the alliance was formed. Consider how their needs have grown or what new pressures they face after {years_passed} years.

Then, generate an event where a messenger from {ally_name} arrives asking for help, informed by the summary you just wrote.

**CHARACTER VOICE:** Embody the ally's messenger - desperate but hopeful, appealing to friendship and honor:
- Reference the alliance and how it was forged
- Show the ally's crisis is REAL and URGENT
- Appeal to honor: "They stood with you once, will you stand with them now?"
- Use phrases like: "Our alliance forged {years_passed} years ago...", "They have not forgotten your friendship...", "In their darkest hour, they turn to you..."

**REACTIVITY REQUIREMENTS:**
- Reference how alliance was formed: "{ally_event}"
- Show time passed: "{years_passed} years of friendship"
- Make the crisis SPECIFIC (famine, invasion, plague, civil war)
- Alliance strength ({alliance_strength}/100) affects tone: stronger = more confident in your aid
- Investigation reveals the severity of their crisis and what they need
- Decisions: help them (expensive but honorable), refuse (cheaper but betrays trust and weakens/breaks alliance)
