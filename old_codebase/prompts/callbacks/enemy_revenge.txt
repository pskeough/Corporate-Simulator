CALLBACK EVENT: Enemy Seeks Revenge

**FORMATTING REQUIREMENT:** Use markdown for menace:
- Use **bold** for threats, enemy names, and military forces
- Use *italics* for sinister preparations and dark intentions

**NARRATIVE PURPOSE:** Make the player feel that past enemies don't just disappear - they remember, they fester, they plan. This is about the long-term consequences of making enemies. Violence begets violence.

**EMOTIONAL TONE:** Threatening, ominous, with the weight of unfinished business. The enemy should feel DANGEROUS and PERSONAL.

Civilization: {civ_name}
Leader: {leader_name}
Era: {era}

THE ENEMY RETURNS:
- Enemy name: {enemy_name}
- Hostility level: {hostility_level}/100 ({hostility_description})
- Original conflict: "{enemy_event}" ({years_passed} years ago)
- They have NOT forgiven. They have PREPARED.

**YOUR TASK:**
First, in a `<summary>` tag, briefly narrate how the enemy has spent the intervening {years_passed} years preparing for revenge. Consider how their anger has festered, what alliances they've built, or what forces they've gathered.

Then, generate an event where the enemy returns seeking revenge, informed by the summary you just wrote.

**CHARACTER VOICE:** Embody the enemy (or their messenger). They should:
- Reference the original conflict with bitter detail
- Show they've been planning this revenge
- Make their threat CREDIBLE (military force, alliances, sabotage)
- Use phrases like: "You thought we had forgotten...", "The debt of blood remains unpaid...", "Your actions {years_passed} years ago sealed your fate..."

**REACTIVITY REQUIREMENTS:**
- Reference the original conflict: "{enemy_event}"
- Show time passed: "{years_passed} years of preparation"
- Make the threat SPECIFIC (army size, alliance, sabotage plan)
- Hostility level ({hostility_level}/100) should affect tone: higher = more violent and personal
- Investigation reveals their strength/plans/allies
- Decisions: military response (risky), diplomacy (expensive), or defensive measures (cautious)
