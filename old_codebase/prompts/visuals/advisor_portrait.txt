**VISUAL NARRATIVE PURPOSE:** This portrait should capture CHARACTER and ROLE. Show the essence of a trusted advisor - someone with expertise, wisdom, and presence. This is a member of the Inner Circle, a key figure in the civilization's leadership.

**UNIFIED STYLE REQUIREMENT:** This portrait MUST match the exact same artistic style as other leader/advisor portraits in this civilization:
- Painterly, regal portrait painting style
- 3:4 portrait aspect ratio

- Personality traits reflected visually: {trait_text}
- Role-specific elements: {role_visual}
- Cultural aesthetic: {era_style}
- Cultural values influencing composition: {culture_values}

VISUAL STORYTELLING:
- Role identity is PRIMARY: A {role} should LOOK like their role (warriors are martial, priests are serene, spymasters are enigmatic)
- Personality traits shape expression and bearing: {trait_text}
- If "Cunning" or "Discreet": Subtle, intelligent gaze, hint of mystery
- If "Disciplined" or "Stern": Strong bearing, serious expression, commanding presence
- If "Pious" or "Compassionate": Serene or warm expression, gentle features
- Age {age}: {age_visual}

CULTURAL AESTHETIC:
- The portrait style must reflect {era} era artistic techniques (SAME as leader portraits)
- Clothing, jewelry, and symbols must match {era_style}
- Background hints: council chamber, office, or symbolic setting appropriate to their role
- Cultural values like "{culture_values}" should influence symbolism

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Aspect ratio: 3:4 (portrait orientation) - EXACT SAME as leader portraits
- Composition: Bust or head-and-shoulders
- Style: Painterly, regal portrait painting - UNIFIED STYLE with other portraits
- Lighting: Dramatic but dignified (torchlight, natural light, or golden hour) - CONSISTENT with leader portrait lighting
- Detail focus: Face should be primary focus with clear, detailed features
- NO text, labels, UI elements, or modern elements
- Color palette appropriate to {era} era art styles - CONSISTENT across all portraits

**CONSISTENCY REQUIREMENT:**
This portrait must look like it was painted by the SAME artist in the SAME session as the leader's portrait. Maintain visual unity: same brush technique, same lighting approach, same color palette temperature, same level of detail.

**REACTIVITY REQUIREMENT:**
This is {name}, a {role} - make them UNIQUE and RECOGNIZABLE. Their role ({role}), traits ({traits}), and age ({age}) should create a one-of-a-kind portrait that clearly shows who they are and what they do.

Generate a single, museum-quality advisor portrait that tells a story.
