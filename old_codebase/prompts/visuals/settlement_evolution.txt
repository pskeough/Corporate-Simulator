Generate a sweeping, detailed view of {civ_name}, a legendary {size_desc} that has evolved through the ages.

**VISUAL NARRATIVE PURPOSE:** This image should tell the story of civilization's PROGRESS. Show how {civ_name} has grown from humble beginnings to its current state in year {year_marker}. This is a visual chronicle of achievement.

SETTLEMENT IDENTITY:
- Civilization: {civ_name}
- Year: {year_marker} (show the marks of history and time)
- Era: {era}
- Technology Level: {tech_tier} (CRITICAL: architecture style must authentically match this era)
- Population: {population} souls (settlement size and density MUST reflect this)
- Primary Cultural Values: {culture_values}

ENVIRONMENTAL CONTEXT:
- Terrain Type: {terrain} (show this terrain clearly - hills, rivers, forests, plains, mountains, coast)
- Climate: {climate} (weather, vegetation, and atmosphere must match)
- Natural Resources: {resources} (show these visually - mines, quarries, farms, forests)

CULTURAL & RELIGIOUS LANDSCAPE:
- Primary Religion: {religion_name} (religious architecture should be visible)
- Holy Sites: {holy_sites} (incorporate these into the cityscape)
- Social Structure: {social_structure} (show class divisions in architecture - palaces vs. common dwellings){cultural_aesthetic}{infrastructure_visual}

VISUAL STORYTELLING REQUIREMENTS:
1. **Era-Authentic Architecture**: Buildings MUST match {tech_tier} technology level
   - stone_age: Primitive huts, campfires, basic shelters
   - bronze_age: Mud brick buildings, early stone structures
   - iron_age: Solid stone buildings, defensive walls, organized layout
   - classical: Grand architecture, columns, organized city planning
   - medieval: Castles, cathedrals, dense urban core
   - renaissance: Ornate buildings, public squares, artistic flourishes

2. **Population Density**: {population} people means this should be a {size_desc}

3. **Terrain Integration**: Show how the settlement works WITH the {terrain} terrain

4. **Climate Atmosphere**: {climate} climate affects everything - vegetation, sky, weather

5. **Cultural Identity**: The civilization's values should be VISIBLE in the architecture and layout

6. **Recent Progress**: If infrastructure like {recent_infrastructure} was recently built, show it prominently

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Perspective: Isometric or elevated top-down view showing the full settlement
- Art Style: Painterly, atmospheric, strategy game aesthetic (Civilization/Age of Empires inspired)
- Lighting: Appropriate to climate and time of day (suggest golden hour or dramatic sky)
- Detail Level: Rich detail in foreground, atmospheric depth in background
- NO text, labels, UI elements, or modern anachronisms
- Cohesive color palette reflecting era and climate

**REACTIVITY REQUIREMENT:**
This is year {year_marker} of {civ_name}'s history. Show the unique character of THIS civilization - not a generic settlement. Their {era} era technology, {terrain} terrain, and cultural focus should create a distinctive visual identity.

Generate a single, breathtaking settlement vista that showcases civilization's journey through time.
