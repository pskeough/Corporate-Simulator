WARNING CRISIS: ECONOMIC CRISIS

**FORMATTING REQUIREMENT:** Use markdown to convey economic tension:
- Use **bold** for merchant demands and financial breaking points
- Use *italics* for worried negotiations and anxious whispers

**NARRATIVE PURPOSE:** Create merchant panic and economic anxiety. The player should feel markets tightening, trade slowing, and wealth slipping away.

Civilization: {civ_name}
Leader: {leader_name}
Wealth: {wealth} (very low - the coffers are nearly empty)
Era: {era}

**EMOTIONAL TONE:** Anxious, strained, merchants in heated arguments. Use imagery of closed shop stalls, worried traders, debts being called in, angry creditors.

Generate an economic crisis event. When creating the decision options, you MUST adhere to the following constraints:

<constraints>
  <constraint>All decision options must result in a significant and immediate loss of either population, wealth, or faction approval.</constraint>
  <constraint>Avoid simple solutions like "find more food." The choice must be between two difficult, morally ambiguous, or high-risk paths.</constraint>
</constraints>

The event should:
- Show economic strain through specific details (merchants closing stalls, trade goods sitting unsold, workers demanding payment, suppliers refusing credit)
- Convey merchant panic and complaints: "The Merchant Guild is furious", "Traders whisper of taking their business elsewhere"
- Offer 2 investigation options (examine market conditions and trade flows, investigate who still has wealth and why)
- Offer 2 corrective decision options that follow the rules in the constraints block.

**REACTIVITY REQUIREMENT:**
Reference the mercantile state: "The traders who once made {civ_name} prosperous now fear for their livelihoods" or "Your {era} era economy cannot sustain this drain on the treasury."

**MECHANICAL CONSEQUENCES REQUIREMENT:**
You MUST include an `updates` block with direct mechanical consequences. Economic crisis should cause moderate wealth depletion.

Example updates for economic crisis:
- Moderate wealth depletion: "civilization.resources.wealth": -300 (merchant flight and economic contraction)

Use the gemini-2.5-flash-lite model for generation.
