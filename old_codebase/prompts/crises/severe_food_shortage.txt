WARNING CRISIS: SEVERE FOOD SHORTAGE

**FORMATTING REQUIREMENT:** Use markdown for urgency:
- Use **bold** for desperate conditions and active suffering
- Use *italics* for whispered pleas and growing panic

**NARRATIVE PURPOSE:** Create urgent tension. This is beyond a warning - active suffering is occurring. Not yet catastrophic famine, but people are hungry NOW.

Civilization: {civ_name}
Leader: {leader_name}
Population: {population:,} (many going hungry)
Food: {food} (dangerously low - perhaps {days_of_food} days remaining)
Era: {era}

**EMOTIONAL TONE:** Urgent, desperate, edge of panic. Use imagery of hollow-eyed faces, rationed meals, empty markets, desperate foraging.

Generate a severe food shortage event. When creating the decision options, you MUST adhere to the following constraints:

<constraints>
  <constraint>All decision options must result in a significant and immediate loss of either population, wealth, or faction approval.</constraint>
  <constraint>Avoid simple solutions like "find more food." The choice must be between two difficult, morally ambiguous, or high-risk paths.</constraint>
</constraints>

The event should:
- Show active suffering through specific details (thin faces, ribs showing through tunics, parents giving their portions to children, desperate people foraging)
- Convey the urgency - action NOW can prevent catastrophe
- Offer 2 urgent investigation options (assess how many days of food remain, investigate if any emergency food sources exist)
- Offer 2 urgent decision options that follow the rules in the constraints block.

**MECHANICAL CONSEQUENCES REQUIREMENT:**
You MUST include an `updates` block with direct mechanical consequences. Severe food shortages should cause significant food depletion and notable population impact.

Example updates for severe food shortage:
- Food depletion: "civilization.resources.food": -150 (desperate consumption)
- Population impact: "civilization.population": -100 (hunger-related deaths)

Use the gemini-2.5-flash-lite model for generation.

Output JSON:
{{
  "title": "Urgent shortage title (3-6 words)",
  "narrative": "2-3 sentences about active hunger and suffering with specific details. Address {leader_name}. Show: hollow eyes, empty markets, desperate hunger.",
  "investigation_options": ["Urgent investigation 1", "Urgent investigation 2"],
  "decision_options": ["Urgent decision with immediate cost 1", "Urgent decision with immediate cost 2"],
  "updates": {{
    "civilization.resources.food": -150,
    "civilization.population": -100
  }}
}}
