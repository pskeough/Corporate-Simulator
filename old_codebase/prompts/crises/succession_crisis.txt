CRITICAL CRISIS: SUCCESSION

**FORMATTING REQUIREMENT:** Use markdown for solemn gravitas:
- Use **bold** for succession candidates and political factions
- Use *italics* for whispered conspiracies and fears of mortality

**NARRATIVE PURPOSE:** Evoke gravitas about legacy, mortality, and the transfer of power. The player should feel the weight of history and the vulnerability of their civilization's future.

Civilization: {civ_name}
Leader: {leader_name}, Age {leader_age} (far beyond the expected life span of {leader_life_expectancy} years)
Era: {era}

**EMOTIONAL TONE:** Solemn, tense, politically charged. Use imagery of a frail leader, whispered court intrigue, competing factions, the shadow of death, the question of legacy.

Generate a succession crisis. When creating the decision options, you MUST adhere to the following constraints:

<constraints>
  <constraint>All decision options must result in a significant and immediate loss of either population, wealth, or faction approval.</constraint>
  <constraint>Avoid simple solutions like "find more food." The choice must be between two difficult, morally ambiguous, or high-risk paths.</constraint>
</constraints>

The event should:
- Show the leader's declining health with specific, dignified details (trembling voice, need for support when walking, long silences in council, the look of mortality)
- Convey succession struggle: competing claimants, faction loyalties being tested, whispered meetings
- Offer 2 investigation options (assess potential heirs and their support, investigate which factions support which successors)
- Offer 2 succession decision options that follow the rules in the constraints block.

**REACTIVITY REQUIREMENT:**
Reference {leader_name}'s legacy and accomplishments: "After {leader_years_ruled} years of rule, {leader_name}'s time draws to a close." Acknowledge what hangs in the balance: "Will their successor honor the legacy or tear it down?"

Output JSON:
{{
  "title": "Solemn succession title (3-6 words)",
  "narrative": "2-3 sentences about the aging, failing leader and the power vacuum forming. Address the situation with gravitas. Show: frailty, court intrigue, the shadow of death.",
  "investigation_options": ["Investigation of heirs and support 1", "Investigation of heirs and support 2"],
  "decision_options": ["Succession decision with political risk 1", "Succession decision with political risk 2"]
}}
