# COMPOUND CRISIS PROMPT
# Generates catastrophic multi-system collapse crisis event.
#
# VARIABLES REQUIRED:
# - civ_name: Civilization name (string)
# - leader_name: Leader name (string)
# - population: Population count (integer, will be formatted with comma separator)
# - food: Food resources (integer)
# - wealth: Wealth resources (integer)
# - happiness: Population happiness percentage (float)
#
# OUTPUT: JSON with title, narrative, investigation_options, decision_options, updates

CRITICAL CRISIS: MULTI-SYSTEM COLLAPSE

**FORMATTING REQUIREMENT:** Use markdown for catastrophic cascading failures:
- Use **bold** for each critical failure point
- Use *italics* for the overwhelming sense of doom
- Use line breaks (\n) to separate each system failure for dramatic impact

**NARRATIVE PURPOSE:** Evoke overwhelming systemic failure. Everything is falling apart at once. This is civilization on the brink.

Civilization: {civ_name}
Leader: {leader_name}
Population: {population:,} (desperate and starving)
Food: {food} (critically low)
Wealth: {wealth} (nearly depleted)
Happiness: {happiness} (civil unrest brewing)

Multiple systems are failing simultaneously. Granaries empty while markets close. Hungry citizens riot as infrastructure crumbles. This is a death spiral.

Generate a compound crisis event showing multiple simultaneous failures with cascading effects. When creating the decision options, you MUST adhere to the following constraints:

<constraints>
  <constraint>All decision options must result in a significant and immediate loss of either population, wealth, or faction approval.</constraint>
  <constraint>Avoid simple solutions like "find more food." The choice must be between two difficult, morally ambiguous, or high-risk paths.</constraint>
</constraints>

**MECHANICAL CONSEQUENCES REQUIREMENT:**
You MUST include an `updates` block with direct mechanical consequences. Compound crises should cause severe multi-system failures.

Example updates for compound crisis:
- Severe population loss: "civilization.population": -300 (deaths from multiple causes)
- Severe food depletion: "civilization.resources.food": -200 (panic consumption)
- Severe wealth depletion: "civilization.resources.wealth": -400 (economic collapse)

Use the gemini-2.5-flash-lite model for generation.

Output JSON:
{{
  "title": "Civilization on the Brink (3-5 words)",
  "narrative": "3-4 sentences showing simultaneous food, wealth, and civil failures. Use specific visceral details. Multiple crises compounding.",
  "investigation_options": ["Assess which crisis to address first", "Investigate if any systems can be salvaged"],
  "decision_options": ["Focus all resources on food (ignore economy)", "Focus on restoring order (ignore food)", "Desperate gamble: borrow heavily to address both (massive debt)"],
  "updates": {{
    "civilization.population": -300,
    "civilization.resources.food": -200,
    "civilization.resources.wealth": -400
  }}
}}
