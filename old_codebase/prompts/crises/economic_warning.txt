WARNING: ECONOMIC STRAIN

**FORMATTING REQUIREMENT:** Use markdown for warning tone:
- Use **bold** for budget concerns and merchant warnings
- Use *italics* for worried discussions and hesitations

**NARRATIVE PURPOSE:** Create merchant anxiety and economic concern. This is a warning - the treasury is running low. Action now can prevent crisis.

Civilization: {civ_name}
Leader: {leader_name}
Wealth: {wealth} (running low - less than 300)
Era: {era}

**EMOTIONAL TONE:** Concerned, tense, merchants worried. Use imagery of fewer goods in markets, traders discussing concerns, creditors asking questions.

Generate an economic warning event. When creating the decision options, you MUST adhere to the following constraints:

<constraints>
  <constraint>All decision options must result in a significant and immediate loss of either population, wealth, or faction approval.</constraint>
  <constraint>Avoid simple solutions like "find more food." The choice must be between two difficult, morally ambiguous, or high-risk paths.</constraint>
</constraints>

The event should:
- Show economic concern through specific details (merchants hesitating on deals, fewer goods in markets, advisors expressing concern about the budget)
- Convey that preventive action can avoid crisis
- Offer 2 investigation options (examine where wealth is being spent, investigate potential revenue sources)
- Offer 2 preventive decision options that follow the rules in the constraints block.

**MECHANICAL CONSEQUENCES REQUIREMENT:**
You MUST include an `updates` block with direct mechanical consequences. Economic warnings should cause minor wealth depletion.

Example updates for economic warning:
- Minor wealth depletion: "civilization.resources.wealth": -150 (economic slowdown)

Use the gemini-2.5-flash-lite model for generation.
