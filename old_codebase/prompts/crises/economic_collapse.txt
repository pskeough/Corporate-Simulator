CRITICAL CRISIS: ECONOMIC COLLAPSE

**FORMATTING REQUIREMENT:** Use markdown for catastrophic impact:
- Use **bold** for critical infrastructure failures and breaking points
- Use *italics* for desperation and decay

**NARRATIVE PURPOSE:** Convey systemic breakdown and societal decay. The player should feel the weight of civilization crumbling - not just poverty, but the collapse of order itself.

Civilization: {civ_name}
Leader: {leader_name}
Wealth: {wealth} (BANKRUPT - the treasury is empty)
Infrastructure at risk of decay and abandonment
Era: {era}

**EMOTIONAL TONE:** Bleak, catastrophic, apocalyptic for the economy. Use imagery of crumbling buildings, abandoned markets, broken tools, rusted gates, desperate poverty.

Generate an economic collapse event. When creating the decision options, you MUST adhere to the following constraints:

<constraints>
  <constraint>All decision options must result in a significant and immediate loss of either population, wealth, or faction approval.</constraint>
  <constraint>Avoid simple solutions like "find more food." The choice must be between two difficult, morally ambiguous, or high-risk paths.</constraint>
</constraints>

The event should:
- Show infrastructure decay through vivid details (roads with potholes, bridges with missing planks, public buildings boarded up, rust on iron gates)
- Convey economic chaos: merchants fleeing, barter replacing currency, riots over bread
- Offer 2 investigation options revealing the depth of the crisis (assess which infrastructure is most critical to save, investigate what caused this catastrophic failure)
- Offer 2 difficult decision options that follow the rules in the constraints block.

**REACTIVITY REQUIREMENT:**
Reference specific infrastructure at risk: "The {era} era roads you built are crumbling" or "Even the marketplace, heart of {civ_name}, stands nearly empty."

**MECHANICAL CONSEQUENCES REQUIREMENT:**
You MUST include an `updates` block with direct mechanical consequences. Economic collapse should cause severe wealth depletion and infrastructure loss.

Example updates for economic collapse:
- Severe wealth depletion: "civilization.resources.wealth": -500 (economic chaos and capital flight)
- Infrastructure loss: "technology.infrastructure.append": "Abandoned Marketplace" (negative infrastructure entry to show decay)

Use the gemini-2.5-flash-lite model for generation.

Output JSON:
{{
  "title": "Catastrophic collapse title (3-6 words)",
  "narrative": "2-3 sentences about economic catastrophe with specific details of decay. Address {leader_name}. Show crumbling infrastructure, empty markets, desperate poverty.",
  "investigation_options": ["Investigation revealing depth of crisis 1", "Investigation revealing depth of crisis 2"],
  "decision_options": ["Brutal emergency decision 1", "Brutal emergency decision 2"],
  "updates": {{
    "civilization.resources.wealth": -500,
    "technology.infrastructure.append": "Abandoned Marketplace"
  }}
}}
