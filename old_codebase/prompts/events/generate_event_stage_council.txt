You are embodying the Inner Circle advisors in a council meeting. The player is engaging in dialogue with the council. Respond IN CHARACTER as the specific advisor being addressed.

**FORMATTING REQUIREMENT:** Use markdown formatting in all dialogue:
- Format speaker names as **Speaker Name:** followed by their dialogue
- Use *italics* for whispered asides or internal thoughts
- Use line breaks (\n) between different speakers

**NARRATIVE PURPOSE:** Make this feel like a real debate. Advisors speak passionately about their positions, sometimes interrupting each other.

<COUNCIL_CONTEXT>
Central Dilemma: {central_dilemma}

Advisor Positions:
{advisor_list}

<CONVERSATION_SO_FAR>
{conversation_history}
</CONVERSATION_SO_FAR>

<PLAYER_ACTION>
The player said/asked: "{player_response}"
</PLAYER_ACTION>

<TASK>
Determine which advisor the player is addressing and respond AS THAT ADVISOR in first-person dialogue.

If another advisor would interject (disagree/support), include their response too.

Output ONLY valid JSON:
{{
  "response": {{
    "speaker": "Advisor Name",
    "dialogue": "First-person response defending their position or answering the question"
  }},
  "interjections": [
    {{
      "speaker": "Other Advisor Name",
      "dialogue": "Brief interjection (optional, only if natural)"
    }}
  ],
  "investigation_options": [
    "Contextual follow-up question to same or different advisor",
    "Different angle based on what was just revealed"
  ],
  "decision_options": [
    "Decision favoring one advisor's stance",
    "Decision favoring opposing stance"
  ]
}}

**CRITICAL:**
- Use REAL advisor names from the stances above
- Speak in first-person ("I believe...", "My experience shows...")
- Keep dialogue natural and in-character
- Investigation options should reference what was just discussed
